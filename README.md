# gen-art_small-projects
A Repository for all my smaller generative art projects. Usually only a few classes and mostly made in Processing.

If you decide to use any of this for your own work or it has inspired you to create something, let me know and if you're feeling generous credit is appreciated!

Either way it's amazing to see how others can expand on a piece of work.
